# Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension
## Reviewed by Theron J Hitchman

Matt Parker enjoys mathematics. We have this in common, you, Matt, and I. Pardon
me the presumption. I assume that you enjoy mathematics. How else would
you be the type of person to wander into a math department common room and pick
up this magazine? Ah, right. Well, that wonderful human being who you are
definitely not surreptitiously-following-around-waiting-to-talk-to is doing
an assignment for a mathematics class and will be busy (and possible frustrated)
for some time. You will have to find something to do. I suggest reading
_Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension_, by Matt Parker.

Don't worry, I am not trying to foist some technical tome at you! Matt wrote this
book for a non-mathematician audience. First of all, it is genuinely funny. Matt
is a "stand-up mathematician", which is sort of like a comedian, and it shows. I
laughed out loud a lot while reading this book. I felt compelled to share
passages with my wife, and she laughed, too. The book has lots of personal
stories in it, and Matt comes across as engaging, enthusiastic, and friendly. He
is having so much fun doing math and he just wants to share that with everyone.
After reading the book, I can't help but think of him as a friend. That's why I
am calling him Matt, here. It feels too weird to type Mr. Parker. Anyway, the
humor keeps you smiling and wanting to turn pages while Matt introduces you to
some really neat things about numbers and shapes.

Second, Matt keeps the language simple and direct. He doesn't assume any
mathematical training from you. That's not quite true. He assumes that
the you have sat through some really dull and off-putting kind of school
mathematics training. I hope you haven't had such a bleak experience.
Anyway, the mathematics chosen is very accessible. Matt starts with some puzzles
about numbers, and uses this as a way to introduce the difference between
thinking about properties of numbers and thinking about properties of ways
numbers are represented. Each topic is like that, where the conversation starts
from something you will definitely understand and eventually draws you to a point
that your average math professor will appreciate. There are dozens of these in
the book, and they would make really good conversation starters with your
friend-to-be at the next math club meeting!

If you had the sort of school mathematics education that Matt worries you did,
then you probably wonder how some people can fall in love with the subject. It
would be a total mystery what a mathematically inclined person would do with
their time. Matt takes the opportunity to show you what doing mathematics
is like: asking questions, running little experiments, making examples, sorting
truths out from the guesses and dead-ends. He shares bits of how the
mathematics community does its work as a group, too. So, you will get a sense of
what your friend-doing-homework is really doing.

I suppose you don't really have a sense of how _experimental_ a subject math is.
At the edges of our knowledge, where we don't quite understand things, we just
have to try things out. A lot of the time this means doing lost of computation,
and so it can be really useful to use a computer to grunt work for you. Several
examples of this come up in the book, and later Matt makes it clear how interested
he is both in using computers to speed up his mathematics and in thinking about
a computer as a mathematical object. This is going to be even more important
in the future than it is now (and right now it is kind of a big deal). The
chapters and pages are numbered starting from zero.


The book has laughs at the rate of one good chuckle per page and mathematics at
the rate of several ideas per chapter. Each chapter is readable in a single sitting
and there is a convenient chapter dependency chart at the beginning of the book.
In the end, the most important thing is that Matt's love for mathematics oozes
off the page, and, like lots of oozes, it is infectious. That makes the book an
enjoyable way to pass the time, so give it a try. Maybe you and your special someone
can learn to appreciate math at the same time.
