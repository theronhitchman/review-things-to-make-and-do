# Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension
## Reviewed by Theron J Hitchman

Matt Parker enjoys mathematics. We have this in common, you, Matt, and I. Pardon
me for the presumption. I assume that you enjoy mathematics. How else would
you be the type of person to wander into a math department common room and pick
up this magazine? Ah, right. Well, that wonderful human being who you are
definitely not surreptitiously-following-around-waiting-to-talk-to is doing
an assignment for a mathematics class and will be busy
for some time. You will have to find something to do. I suggest reading
_Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension_, by Matt Parker.

Don't worry. I'm not trying to foist some technical tome on you! Matt wrote this
book for a non-mathematician audience. First, it is genuinely funny. Matt
is a "stand-up mathematician", a type of comedian, and it shows. I
laughed out loud a lot while reading this book. I felt compelled to share
passages with my wife, and she laughed, too. There is a lot of wordplay. The
humor keeps you smiling and turning pages while Matt introduces you to
some neat things about numbers and shapes. The book has many personal stories,
and Matt is engaging, enthusiastic, and friendly. He is having so much fun doing
math and he just wants to share that with everyone. After reading the book, I
can't help but call him Matt. It feels weird to say Mr. Parker.

Second, Matt keeps the language simple and direct. He doesn't assume any
mathematical training from you. Actually, that's not true. He assumes that
you have sat through some really dull and off-putting kind of school
mathematics training. I hope you haven't had such a bleak experience.
Anyway, the mathematics chosen is very accessible. Matt starts with some puzzles
about numbers, and uses this as a way to introduce the difference between
thinking about properties of numbers and thinking about properties of ways
numbers are represented. Each topic is like that, where the conversation starts
from something you will definitely understand and eventually draws you to a point
that your mathy friend-to-be will appreciate. There are dozens of these in
the book, and they would make good conversation starters with your
friend at the next math club meeting!

If you had the sort of school mathematics education that Matt worries you did,
then you probably wonder what a mathematically inclined person does with
their time. Matt takes the opportunity to show you what doing mathematics
is like: asking questions, running experiments, making examples, sorting
truths out from the guesses and dead-ends. He shares bits of how the
mathematics community does its work as a group, too. You will get a sense of
what your friend-doing-homework is really doing.

I suppose you don't know how _experimental_ a subject math is.
At the edges of our knowledge, we just have to try things out. A lot of the time
this means doing computation, and so it can be important to use a
computer to do grunt work for you. Several examples of this come up in the book,
and the interaction between mathematics and computers becomes a major theme
later on. You get a hint of this if you notice that the chapters and pages are
numbered starting from zero. Eventually, you get a bit of exploration of how a
computer is a type of mathematical object with some interesting bits of history.

The book has laughs at the rate of one good chuckle per page and mathematics at
the rate of several ideas per chapter. Each chapter is readable in a single
sitting. Matt pokes fun at typical math textbooks by including a convenient
chapter dependency chart at the beginning of the book and a section called "The
Answers at the Back of the Book". All of the displayed diagrams and equations
have friendly, hand-drawn look so as not to be too scary. In the end, the most
important thing is that Matt's love for mathematics oozes off the page, and,
like lots of oozes, it is infectious. That makes the book an enjoyable way to
pass the time, so give it a try. Maybe you and your special someone can learn to
appreciate math together.
